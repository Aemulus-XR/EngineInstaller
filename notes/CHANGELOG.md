# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2025-12-30)


### Bug Fixes

* add multithreading to the extraction to speed things up ([0118519](https://github.com/Aemulus-XR/EngineInstaller/commit/011851903e73c7651a4706df503c37258da4e187))
* delete old archive before ([ce1316b](https://github.com/Aemulus-XR/EngineInstaller/commit/ce1316b6bea604f552e9ef48f468cd51012d226c))
* include the full intermediate buildrules folder - UE needs this ([d9519bd](https://github.com/Aemulus-XR/EngineInstaller/commit/d9519bd8c6924bc7ea471bc041829e5e3013a20d))
* string literal being interpreted incorrectly ([5590617](https://github.com/Aemulus-XR/EngineInstaller/commit/5590617d95efeb398eeef0717953bc127ae91981))
* update to basic new installer (wip) that downloads and installs from dropbox rather than trying to include the full engine in the installer ([707e81e](https://github.com/Aemulus-XR/EngineInstaller/commit/707e81efb93e42ed4093d4dcb14c73030e5976d1))
